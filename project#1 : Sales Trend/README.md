# Sales Project


I sourced the dataset from Kaggle and subsequently converted it into a database-like format using Python functions. 
Employing various techniques, I leveraged a date column on the table to extract and analyze trends.

# Tools:
- Python
- Tableau

## Visualization:
For each trend analysis, charts were provided for visualization, utilizing the power of Python's libraries like Hvplot and Seaborn.
I also created a **dashboard** to compile key findings into dynamic and interactive charts. 
Check my interactive dashboard through this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/albertyo.chandra/viz/sales_practice_16992512978280/Dashboard1)
